    <h1 class="title">My problem with Scrum &amp; Agile organizations</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      

<p>Many leaders think that being Agile is doing Scrum with development teams.
Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Agility isn&rsquo;t only about delivering software with a better quality, faster and more regularly. It&rsquo;s about providing products ahead of the competion, reacting quickly to market opportunities, growing your customer base and increasing your revenues.</p>

<p>Scrum focuses on the process of how to build things and make a team collaborate and get better, but Scrum doesn&rsquo;t say much about the customer. The customer is represented by the Product Owner who has to know precisely what the customer wants. Building quickly and iteratively the wrong product won&rsquo;t make your company successful, you will keep at loosing customers to the competition.</p>

<p>Being good at delivering the wrong product is not enough.</p>

<h1 id="focus-on-and-speed">Focus on $$$ and speed</h1>

<p>Scrum framework focuses on their velocity, how many features are developed per sprint. This metric measures the amount of work the team is able to do in a fixed amount of time. Having a stable velocity means being able to deliver things in a predictable way.</p>

<p>Now, all features aren&rsquo;t equal. Some have a big impact for the customers, some will never be used by anyone. So, for a customer, 2 stories of 5 Story Points are really not equal.</p>

<p>As an &ldquo;agile&rdquo; organization, we want to seize opportunities, we want to deliver value to customer, not story points. So instead of being focused on the team velocity, we must focus on $$$ delivered. Instead of constantly delivering features, we must be sure we constantly deliver customer value.</p>

<p>Many agile trainings and books focus on development practices, the role of the scrum master, the different practices that help the team to estimate and deliver features with a good level of quality.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing so much about how to deliver stuff and how to get organized to deliver it, we should focus first on how many $$$ we deliver.</p>

<p>How to know what to deliver?</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s obvious, but very often it&rsquo;s not clear at all. You have 10 different possibilites and you have enough throughput to fully implent 3 of them in the next quarter. How to make sure you&rsquo;re betting on the right horse?</p>

<h1 id="get-real-metrics-talk-to-customers">Get real metrics &amp; talk to customers</h1>

<p>You have a vision, a strategy for your product, but you don&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s the next thing you need to build.</p>

<p>Define a goal with the team such as &ldquo;increase by X% the number of customers&rdquo; that goes in the direction of your vision. Then talk with your customers to find a way to reach this goal. Not to somebody in your company who thinks he represents the customer. No, find a way to talk to your customers, look at how they use your product, understand what they are trying to do and what goes on their way, what problem they face.
This will help you to find what feature you should build to reach this goal and make the customer happy.</p>

<p>Estimate with the team the size of the feature. If it&rsquo;s small feature, then you can build it. If it&rsquo;s a medium or large feature, evaluate what subset of the feature you could build for a small price to figure out that customers actually need it.</p>

<p>Before you implement your feature, define a clear target to consider if it&rsquo;s a success or a failure, and find with your team a way to measure it.</p>

<p>Then build and evaluate. Did the feature hit the target? No? then talk to your customers and look at the data you have. Was the feature usable? Did the user understand the feature? Was it just useless? If it wasn&rsquo;t very useful, remove the feature and pick another one. If you failed, make sure you learned something so you don&rsquo;t make the same mistake next time.</p>

<h1 id="what-does-it-mean-for-developers">What does it mean for developers</h1>

<p>Development team must be able to deliver quickly one feature at the time, deploy it, and measure the impact the feature on the customer.</p>

<p>In order to deliver in production often and quickly, the code quality must be good enough, the architecture be flexible and simple enough to add and remove features in a short amount of time. It also means that there must be enough tests and monitoring in place to release often with a low risk.</p>

<p>Developers must build a fast feedback loop system to validate assumptions and quickly move forward.</p>

<h1 id="scrum-and-agile-organizations">Scrum and Agile organizations</h1>

<p>Scrum isn&rsquo;t bad, it&rsquo;s just a local optimization: make your development teams predictable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a bad thing, it&rsquo;s just not enough to build a great product that customers love.</p>

<p>An agile organization must communicate clearly the strategy with their employees. They must stay close to their customers, experiment quickly, learn and adjust the plan constantly.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time for the &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; world to recognize that the Product Owner needs to do more than writting User Stories, prioritize the backlog and validate the developers work.</p>
