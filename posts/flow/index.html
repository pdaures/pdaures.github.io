    <h1 class="title">My problem with Scrum</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      

<p>Many leaders think that being Agile is doing Scrum with development teams.
Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Agility isn&rsquo;t only about delivering software with a better quality, faster and more regularly. It&rsquo;s about providing products ahead of the competion, quickly react to market opportunities, grow your customer base and increase your revenues.</p>

<p>For this reason, Scrum itself won&rsquo;t make your company agile. Good, now I have your attention.</p>

<h1 id="focus-on-and-speed">Focus on $$$ and speed</h1>

<p>Scrum teams often focus on their velocity, how many features are developed per sprint. This metric measures the amount of work the team is able to do in a fixed amount of time. Having a stable velocity means being able to deliver things in a predictable way.</p>

<p>Now, all features aren&rsquo;t equal. Some features are big, some are small, some have a big impact for the customers, some will never be used by anyone. So, for a customer, 2 stories of 5 Story Points are really not equal.</p>

<p>As an &ldquo;agile&rdquo; organisation, we want to seize opportunities, we want to deliver value to customer, not story points. So instead of being focused on the team velocity, we must focus on $$$ delivered. Instead of constantly delivering features, we must be sure we constantly deliver customer value.</p>

<p>Many agile trainings and books focus on development practices, the role of the scrum master, the different practices that help the team to estimate and deliver features with a good level of quality.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing so much about how to deliver stuff and how to get organised to deliver it, we should focus first on how many $$$ we deliver.</p>

<p>How to know what to deliver?</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s obvious, but very often it&rsquo;s not clear at all. You have 10 different possibilites and you have enough throughput to fully implent 3 of them in the next quarter. How to make sure you&rsquo;re betting on the right horse?</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t really be sure, so you have to make assumptions about what will have the biggest impact on your customer, find a way to measure if your assumptions are correct, put the assumption in front of your customer, measure their reaction and adjust your plan. Did you customers love it? Do they want more of it? Then deliver more. Nobody used the feature? Analyse why and kill the feature if you were wrong.</p>

<p>This means that the development team must be able to deliver quickly one feature at the time, quickly deploy it to production so assumptions can be validated.</p>

<p>In order to deliver in production often and quickly, the code quality must be good enough, the architecture be flexible and simple enough to add and remove features in a short amount of time. It also means that there must be enough tests and monitoring in place to release often with a low risk. Finally, there should be some A/B testing and business metrics in place to keep track of the user activity.</p>

<p>We should focus on having a fast feedback loop to validate assumptions</p>

<h1 id="what-s-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h1>

<p>Organisations should make their work queues visible and evaluate the cost of delay of each item and prioritise them accordingly, so the top promising items can be validated first. Organisation should hunt for blocked item and unblock them, for instance projects that have been in validation for 6 months.</p>

<p>Organisations should also make each feature assumption clear, visible, and define ways to measure and validate them quickly, and do it.</p>

<p>Finally, organisation should prioritize work proposed by the development team to keep the archicture and the delivery pipeline simple and fast, so features can be delivered and evaluated quickly.</p>
